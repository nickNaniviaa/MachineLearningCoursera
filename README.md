# Machine Learning - CS229 - AndrewNG - Coursera

## Intro
This is a series of Machine Learning related exercises done in MatLAB, in accordance to the Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course (available in Coursera) - mostly based on Stanford's CS229 original class.

The core idea behind those exercises was to use the most modularized and efficient input/coding - so all approaches (when possible) are vectorized and really eficient. If I recall correctly, only Recommender Systems had `for` clausules, as in some cases you have to iter for each user/item.

If you have any questions and have been struggling with this course, feel free to drop me a message.

## To run:
Those are most scripts, each exercise has at least one "core" script, which should be used in order you can run each one of them. 

I'd go with opensource **Octave** - but you can also use MatLab (not sure if it has UNIX support thou) - to run, just type script name in Octave's shell.

Assuming your shell is in the right folder - *e.g.*:
`ex7`

Will run ex7 - poping up the graphs and `fprintf`/`disp` functions


## Personal Advice:

I started this course in late late 2017 - studied for about two months and dropped it only to resume by mid 2020. The coursera structure was somewhat demotivating - I felt it lacked application/implementation topics and couldn't really feel comfortable with studying the algebra/calculus behind it without knowing how to do proper EDA and so and on. 2020 kicks in, after couple years working with data - I felt it was much more important right now and could grasp the course's purpose way better. I feel like there are two reasons to postpone this course:

If you feel overwhelmed by calculus (it wasn't my case, but still):
- **Don't aim** towards any course that explores even more "Data Science" & Machine Learning Stuff - your lack of base skills will cost your understanding and you will not be able to fully understand even simpler, trivial mathematical explanations;
- Study algebra and calculus. It is important and crucial.

If you feel overwhelmed by lack of purpose (my case):
- Study some more relaxing courses (Udacity / Data Camp) - which focus on application rather than the math;
- Read some documentation and follow "Exploration Notebooks" on Kaggle, those are really entertaining and I can't stress enough how useful they are.
