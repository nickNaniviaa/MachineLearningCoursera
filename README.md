# Machine Learning - CS229 - AndrewNG - Coursera
This is a series of Machine Learning related exercises done in MatLAB, in accordance to the Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course (available in Coursera). This is a watered down class based on Stanford's CS229 class.

I've put this temporarily on hold as I had to do other projects. As I lacked a bit of statistical and mathematical knowledge for understanding _arXiv_ papers, I decided to take a couple steps back and begin studying properly statistics and mathematics.
