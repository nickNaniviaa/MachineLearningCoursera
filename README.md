# Machine Learning - CS229 - AndrewNG - Coursera

## Intro
This is a series of Machine Learning related exercises done in MatLAB, in accordance to the Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course (available in Coursera) - mostly based on Stanford's CS229 original class.

The core idea behind those exercises was to use the most modularized and efficient input/coding - so all approaches (when possible) are vectorized and really eficient. If I recall correctly, only Recommender Systems had `for` clausules, as in some cases you have to iter for each user/item.

If you have any questions and have been struggling with this course, feel free to drop me a message.

## To run:
Those are most scripts, each exercise has at least one "core" script, which should be used in order you can run each one of them. 

I'd go with opensource **Octave** - but you can also use MatLab (not sure if it has UNIX support thou).


## Personal Advice:

I started this course in late late 2017 - studied for about two months and dropped it only to resume by mid 2020. The coursera structure was extremely demotivating - I felt lack of purpose and couldn't really feel how important was to understand some calculus - feeling much more confident with the general purpose of it.

If you feel overwhelmed by calculus (it wasn't my case, but still):
- **Don't aim** towards any course that explores even more "Data Science" & Machine Learning Stuff;
- Study algebra and calculus. It is important.

If you feel overwhelmed by lack of purpose (my case):
- Study some relaxing courses (Udacity / Data Camp);
- Read some documentation and follow "Exploration Notebooks" on Kaggle, those are really entertaining and I can't stress enough how useful they are.
